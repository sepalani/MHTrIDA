# Audio file format

The SRT/SSD files can be read with the following tools:
 - [zwsrt](https://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html) which generates **zwdsp files** playable with [vgmstream](https://vgmstream.org/)

I don't know if there are existing tools for the other audio filetypes the game has (TSB and WHD).
